Welcome to my first challenge with the inclusion of JS in my html/css designs.

In this challenge there's 2 major designs. What the page looks like when you first open it, what it looks like after you've submit your review. Both states need to be created.

I first started with the HTML and getting everything in it's respective place in the body.

I followed up with using CSS to style the first state. I used individual button elements. Not sure if there may have been a better way.

I've gotten the html/css design for the first page state completed and i'll submit this to my public repo as the first publish. I'll publish again with a second active state and a third publish with the JS incorporated and bridging everything together.

After a few weeks of learning and implementing JS in a much smaller scope, I was finally able to make the page reactive.

Originally, I was going to make 2 seperate html pages that would load according to whatever function was being executed at the time but this brought problems which on a larger scale might affect load times and load functionality.

To resolve this, I created a div element that reacts to the onclick function and will replace the current showing div. This keeps everything on 1 html document maximizing load speed and also allowing the function to run linear with minimal files.

Any feedback is appreciated
